Introduction
    Why is this important
    Overview of Hash Functions
    Overview of what we did
    "Background"
Semantics of Similarity
    Binary Similarity
        what sorts of files does this work/notwork for?
Implementation 
    Overview
    Processing Files
        Scanning, Sum Tables
        HashKey
        Database
    Finding Similar Files
        Key Hits
        Sum Hits
    Additions 
        Multiple Keys
        More Pairwise testing
        Identical files
Results
    Experimenting with Different Keys
